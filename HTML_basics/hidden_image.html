    <h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
    
        <div><h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings are 3 awesome fantasy films that are set in a fictional fantasy world.
            These films were based off a trilogy of novels written by JJR Tolkien. 
            The films were extremely infulental.
            All three films were shot in new zealand (very expensive) and then 
            they proceeded to create a prequel/sequel, called The 
            Hobbit which was another film series that received tons of money 
            as well. These films were very ambitious, as they funded millions 
            into only the first movie being made, but luck favored these directors
            as they gained wonderful recognition and won 17 academey awards 
            out of 30 times they were nominated! 
        </p>

         <div><h3>More to be said though..</h3>
        <p> Between 1937 and 1949 the book series were all written. 
            Much of them were written during World War II.
            The lord of the Rings was originally published in a trilogy in 1954 
            and 1955. Since then it has been reprinted thousands of times, and 
            has been translated into around 38 different languages. 
            These books became one of the most popular pieces of literature 
            in the 20th century, and places like russia and ukraine took a strong
            liking to these books as well.
            The action in The Lord of the Rings's setting is in a place called, 
            the lands of the real Earth, similar to our world but is inhabited by
             creatures like orcs, wizards, dwarfs and other fantastical beings. 
             The author named his setting, Middle-earth, his own version of the 
             Old English Middangeard.
