        <div><h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings are 3 films that are set in a  fictional fantasy world.
            These films were based off a trilogy of novels written by JJR Tolkien. The films 
            were extremely infulental and they won 17 academey awards out of 30 times they were nominated! 
            All three films were shot in new zealand (very expensive) and then they proceeded to create a prequel/sequel, called The 
            Hobbit which was another film series that received tons of money as well.
