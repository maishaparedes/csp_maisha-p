        <div> <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Taking off, and paving the road for indie horror, the game Five nights at Freddys
            was first released for windows on August 8th, 2014.
            The original game revolved around a character the player controlled named Mike
            Schmidt, who began working as a security guard at a Famiy Pizzeria located in Hurricane Utah.
            This Pizzeria didn't run on acarde games or delicious pizza, but two animatronics
            known as Fredbear, (Golden Freddy) and Bonnie.
            The player must survive the dangers of these animitronics for five nights, and only then
            can they win the game. The success of this creation led to the making of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_media"
            target="_blank">  multiple sequels, spin offs, and games made after, some of them simply standalone. </a>

            <h3>Who made it?</h3>
        <p id="who"> Scott Cawthon, a game developer, started by creating many adventure games
            that targeted a christian audiences, but since his games didn't gain much
            traction, eventually he quit. After this slump, over the course of 6 months
            Scott created his first game in a long time, which ended up achieveing almost
            instant internet fame around 2014-2015. More people began to publish playthroughs
        of this game on Youtube after Markiplier, a popular gamer, helped lift the indie game
    out of anonominity. The franchise currently has 11 main video games but 30 total. </p>

<p>You found the secret paragraph! (spoilers) So, obviously there must be more to say. Let's start with, not my favorite character of this horror franchise, but the most intertesting one, William Afton, who explains the more dark side of these already dark games. 
 Afton was an evil man, a serial killer who murdered many many small children, in hopes of 'absorbing' their life essence, allowing him to become immortal. After watching the deaths of his two children, Elizabeth Afton and his Unnamed son, William seemingly developed a fear of that death, which may have been the root of his corrupt motivations to evade mortality. The murder of these ALL these children only went on to possess the Animatronics at his pizza establishment. This, is William Afton, and this, is what began <i>Five nights at Freddys.</i>
