            <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <p> 300,000 acres of salt. Thats a lot of salt, but contrary to what I'm sure the person reading this is thinking, that much salt can be put to good use, and it is, in Utah's Lake Bonville region. Just white plain land that strectches roughly 468.75 miles is an area where drivers thrive. Races at these salt flats are done various times a day, admissions ranging from 25$ for one day and 100$ for a whole week! This natural area, notorious for it's races, is famous internationally, collecting visits from people all over the globe.</p>
